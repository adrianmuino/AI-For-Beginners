# Build an Ontology

> Building a knowledge base is all about categorizing a model representing facts about a topic. Pick a topic - like a person, a place, or a thing - and then build a model of that topic. Use some of the techniques and model-building strategies described in this lesson. An example would be creating an ontology of a living room with furniture, lights, and so on. How does the living room differ from the kitchen? The bathroom? How do you know it's a living room and not a dining room? Use [Protégé](https://protege.stanford.edu/) to build your ontology.

Creating an ontology involves categorizing and modeling a topic to represent facts about it. For this assignment, let's create an ontology of a "**Smart Home.**" This ontology will include various rooms and their respective components. We'll use some key techniques and strategies for model building, such as categorization, hierarchical structure, and relationships. Here's how to approach it:

# Topic: Smart Home Ontology
## Step 1: Define the Scope

The scope of this ontology will cover the main rooms of a smart home and the devices typically found in each room. We will categorize rooms and define their components and functionalities.

## Step 2: Categorize and Define Classes

We'll start by defining the main classes and subclasses.

### Main Classes:

1. Room
2. Device

### Subclasses of Room:

* Living Room
* Kitchen
* Bathroom
* Bedroom
* Dining Room

### Subclasses of Device:

* Furniture
* Appliances
* Lights
* Sensors
* Entertainment

## Step 3: Define Properties and Relationships

Next, we'll define properties and relationships between the classes.

### Properties of Room:

* hasDevice (links a room to its devices)
* hasFunction (describes the function of the room)

### Properties of Device:

* isLocatedIn (links a device to the room it's located in)
* hasFunction (describes the function of the device)

## Step 4: Create Instances

We’ll create instances for each class to represent specific objects.

### Example Instances:

* Living Room: livingRoom1
* Kitchen: kitchen1
* Bathroom: bathroom1
* Sofa: sofa1 (subclass of Furniture, located in livingRoom1)
* Smart TV: smartTV1 (subclass of Entertainment, located in livingRoom1)
* Refrigerator: refrigerator1 (subclass of Appliances, located in kitchen1)
* Light Sensor: lightSensor1 (subclass of Sensors, located in bathroom1)

## Step 5: Using Protégé to Build the Ontology

1. Download and Install Protégé:

* Download Protégé from Protégé's official website.
* Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

2. Create a New Ontology:

* Open Protégé and create a new ontology.
* Set the IRI (Internationalized Resource Identifier) for your ontology.

3. Define Classes:

* In the "Classes" tab, create the main classes `Room` and `Device`.
* Create subclasses under `Room` (Living Room, Kitchen, Bathroom, Bedroom, Dining Room).
* Create subclasses under `Device` (Furniture, Appliances, Lights, Sensors, Entertainment).

4. Define Properties:

* In the "Object Properties" tab, create properties `hasDevice` and `isLocatedIn`.
* In the "Data Properties" tab, create properties `hasFunction`.

5. Create Instances:

* In the "Individuals" tab, create instances for each class.
* For example, create an individual `livingRoom1` for the class `Living Room`.

6. Link Instances with Properties:

* Link `livingRoom1` to `sofa1` using the `hasDevice` property.
* Link `sofa1` to `livingRoom1` using the `isLocatedIn` property.

7. Add Functions:

* Add data properties to describe the function of each room and device.

## Example Structure in Protégé:

### Classes:

Room

* Living Room
* Kitchen
* Bathroom
* Bedroom
* Dining Room

Device

* Furniture
* Appliances
* Lights
* Sensors
* Entertainment

### Properties:

Object Properties:

* hasDevice
* isLocatedIn

Data Properties:

* hasFunction

Individuals:

* livingRoom1 (instance of Living Room)
* sofa1 (instance of Furniture, located in livingRoom1)
* smartTV1 (instance of Entertainment, located in livingRoom1)
* kitchen1 (instance of Kitchen)
* refrigerator1 (instance of Appliances, located in kitchen1)
* bathroom1 (instance of Bathroom)
* lightSensor1 (instance of Sensors, located in bathroom1)

## Final Thoughts
This ontology can be extended further by adding more details, such as additional devices, more properties, and specific functionalities. Building an ontology helps in organizing knowledge in a structured way, which can be very useful for various applications like smart home management, AI reasoning, and more.
